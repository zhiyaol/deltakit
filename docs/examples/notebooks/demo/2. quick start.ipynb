    "QEC experiment today is build around performing some error-corrected operation multiple times. One of the types of such operation is called **quantum memory experiment**.\n",
    "This experiment prepares a logical basis state (e.g. $|0\\rangle_L$), performs error correction of a logical qubit for some number of rounds and then measures the logical state ($|\\psi\\rangle_L$, which might be the same, of flipped).\n",
    "Measured states in multiple \"shots\" are compared with predictions of a decoder. The closer predictions are to the logical state - the better is the combination of the code and the decoder.\n",

    "In an error corrected circuit `qubit0` becomes a set of qubits (aka data qubits). Unlike in classical error correction, these qubits\n",
    "cannot be measured while executing the algorithm, without disrupting the calculations. That is why data qubits are sneakily followed by ancillary qubits.\n",
    "Ancillary qubits entagle with neighbouring data qubits and perform the role of parity check. Every round of an experiment we measure\n",
    "ancillary qubits to learn if a state flip happened to their neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "QEC codes define which qubits perform which roles and how they entangle. Decoders use ancillary qubit measurements to predict corruption of a logical state."
