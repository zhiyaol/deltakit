# Should only contain project-wide configuration.
#
# Note that:
# - if a Ruff configuration file is present in any subdirectory
#   and does not contain an "extend" value pointing directly or
#   indirectly (through a chain of "extend" to this file
#   then this file is completely ignored by ruff,
# - if the "extend" value directly or indirectly points to this
#   file, values set here are used EXCEPT if redefined in a ruff
#   configuration file deeper in the folder tree. Redefinition of
#   values OVERRIDES the previously set value.

# Exclude a variety of commonly ignored directories.
